							<h2>About me</h2>
							<p class="paragraph">I was born and raised in the South of France in the nineties of a Canadian &#127464;&#127462; mother and a French &#127467;&#127479; father. I have a younger brother and an older sister. Growing up I did lots of sports, I still do today, especially the ones that involve boards. I have also (too) many other hobbies that you will know if you ever met me. In my twenties, I studied in Montpellier, France and did an exchange program in Mexico. I graduated from Montpellier Business School with a Master’s Degree which opened the door to the next section of this page... work.</p>

							<h2>Work</h2>
							<p class="paragraph">I work in the software sector, for internet-based companies and startups. I am currently full-time employed as a Product Manager by Shopify, the company behind the incredible multi-channel commerce software. Prior to that, I worked in startups across different industries. I have been fascinated by internet companies for while, and it was always a goal for me to work for some of the best internet companies out there.</p>
							<br>
							<p class="paragraph">I like to use both sides of my brain to find solutions to problems that help people live their lives the way they want it. Some internet companies and their products have massive leverage in changing people’s lives, Shopify is one of them. The relatively small number of people who contribute to build these platforms and products makes the job incredibly interesting and intellectually stimulating. So I guess I’m going to continue doing it for a while!</p>
